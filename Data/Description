The flow rate statistics used in this study were provided by LGL (Lalonde, Girouard & Letendre Canadian consultants) S.A. freelance experts and the Haitian public services. Data relating to the 1919–1943 period have been chosen, as other available data lacked the continuity and duration that we considered acceptable. Indeed, due to political instabilities, no daily data for longer than 2 years were available after year 1943. The dataset yielded 26 daily time series pertaining to 17 watersheds (and 43% of the country’s surface), and covering at least five complete years (without missing a single day), but not necessarily continuous years.
